In openSUSE if you wanna start/stop Firewall or configure it, you must run SuSEfirewall2 in terminal or select the firewall management from Yast, a little inconvenient.

In other Linux distribution also have this problem.

1. Applet for gnome that could start and stop firewall quickly.

2. A simple and friendly GUI for displaying and administering firewall rules.

3. Provide a status what blocked and allowed by firewall.
